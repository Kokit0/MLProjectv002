## whats_inside_utils.py

This code is a collection of utility functions defined in a file called `utils.py` for a machine learning project. Let's go through each function and understand its purpose and logic.

1. **Importing Libraries**: The code starts by importing necessary libraries such as `os`, `sys`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `dill`, `pickle`, `sklearn.metrics`, and `sklearn.model_selection`. These libraries provide various functionalities required for the rest of the code.

2. **CustomException**: It seems that the `CustomException` class is defined in another module or file called `src.exception`. This class is used for raising custom exceptions in case of any errors or exceptions in the code.

3. **save_object(file_path, obj)**: This function is used to save an object (i.e., Python variable) to a file using the pickle module. It takes two parameters: `file_path` (a string representing the path where the object should be saved) and `obj` (the object to be saved). The function creates the necessary directory structure (if it doesn't exist) using `os.makedirs()`, and then it writes the object to the file using `pickle.dump()`.

4. **evaluate_models(X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test, models, param)**: This function is used to evaluate multiple machine learning models using grid search and cross-validation. It takes six parameters: `X_train` (the training dataset features), `y_train` (the training dataset labels), `X_test` (the testing dataset features), `y_test` (the testing dataset labels), `models` (a dictionary of machine learning models), and `param` (a dictionary of hyperparameter grids for each model).

   Inside the function, a loop is performed over the models. For each model, a grid search is conducted using `GridSearchCV` from scikit-learn, which performs cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning. The best parameters found during grid search are then set on the model using `model.set_params()` and the model is trained on the training data using `model.fit()`.
   
   After training, predictions are made on both the training and testing data using `model.predict()`. The R-squared score is computed using `r2_score()` from scikit-learn to evaluate the performance of the model on both datasets.
   
   Finally, the R-squared scores of all the models are stored in a dictionary called `report` and returned.

5. **load_object(file_path)**: This function is used to load an object from a file using the pickle module. It takes one parameter: `file_path` (a string representing the path of the file to be loaded). The function opens the file in binary mode using `open(file_path, "rb")`, reads the object from the file using `pickle.load()`, and returns the loaded object.

Both `save_object()` and `load_object()` functions handle exceptions using a try-except block. If any exception occurs during file operations or object serialization/deserialization, a `CustomException` is raised with the original exception and `sys` (the `sys` module) as additional information.

Overall, this `utils.py` file provides utility functions for saving and loading objects using pickle, evaluating machine learning models with grid search, and handling custom exceptions for error reporting. These functions can be used by other parts of the machine learning project to perform common tasks efficiently.
